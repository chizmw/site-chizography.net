If you know me at all before dicovering this post you won't be even slightly
surprised to learn what I'm about to say:

> I really enjoy board games

<!--more-->

I have a copy of Monopoly somewhere, but with a [collection of easily more
than 300 games][chisel-games] I think you'll agree that there must be more to
board games than Monopoly, Cluedo, and Scrabble.

The best way to find out more is to talk to me, but if you're even mildly
curious:

* [check out photos from games I've played][games-photos]
* [browse my collection][chisel-games]
